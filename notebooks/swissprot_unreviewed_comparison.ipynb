Since the uniprot pagination downloader that we implemented can download about 3000 proteins per minute, this download would take almost two months to complete.\n",

This download only contains 257,658 proteins. This means that we no longer have the option of including proteins that were verified at transcript level, but for unreviewed proteins that might be a bad idea anyways."
